# flutter_search_bar_testing

Testing some different ways to show search bars in flutter. These are pretty much incomplete and
not necessarily intended or ready to be used in production without some refactors or additions.

## ExpandingSearchBar

A widget stacked on top of the AppBar that expands to fill the space of AppBar when tapped, and
begins search at that time.

## SlidingSearchBar

A widget stacked on top of the AppBar that looks like an Action, but is of course on top instead of
inside the AppBar. When tapped, the entire search bar slides out from the button to the left, and
search begins.
